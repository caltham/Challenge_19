UNCC Online FinTech Bootcamp Module 19

## Executive Summary

As Fintech Finderâ€™s lead developer, I have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable my customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

I will complete the code that enables my customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, I will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.

- Streamlit (an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science teams.)
- Web3.py (a Python library for interacting with Ethereum. It's commonly found in decentralized apps.)
- Ganache (an Ethereum simulator that makes developing Ethereum applications faster, easier, and safer.)
- Mnemonic (used for generating deterministic keys.)
- bip44 (defines the standard derivation path for wallets which generate Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash addresses.)
